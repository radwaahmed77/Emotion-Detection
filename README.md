# Emotion-Detection
Developed an NLP-based text classification model to detect emotions (e.g., joy, anger, sadness) from user input. Performed data preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal), feature extraction (TF-IDF), and trained models using algorithms like Logistic Regression. Achieved high accuracy and F1-score in model evaluation.
